<p style="text-align:justify;"> Conducted research to effectively enhance object detection and localization for autonomous systems (autonomous vehicles) during adverse weather conditions where visibility is disrupted or minimal. This work employed an effective object detection algorithm (YOLOv9), an image enhancement neural network (Real-ESRGAN), and a hybrid dataset (ACDC and DAWN) depicting real-world severe conditions such as sandstorms, rainstorms, snow, and fog. The result was a custom object detection model capable of detecting non-static objects while an autonomous vehicle navigates inclement weather conditions with a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.93, 0.93, 0.98, and 0.96 for fog, sandstorm, rain, and snow, respectively.</p>  The entire report can be accessed here <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HANwoeM-xiakPYh7QK1_6NVXhjdMNWV0/view?usp=sharing">Link</a>
