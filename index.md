I am a multidisciplinary graduate student with a background in **Computer Science and Engineering**. I hold a **Master of Science** degree in **Computer Science** and a **Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering** from the **University of Ghana, Legon**.

My research interest lies in these domains:
 -  **Computer Vision**: The creation, exploration, and application of innovative computer vision algorithms to **detect objects and anomalies**, **comprehend scenes**, and **monitor events and systems**  in areas such as **healthcare**, **automotive**, and **manufacturing**. 
 -  **System Optimization**:  Exploring the fundamental principles underlying **machine learning algorithms**  in combination with **big data analysis** for efficient system optimization. 
**Other Interest**:  Product Design and Development

In addition, I have professional experience in data analysis, applying quantitative and computational techniques to derive insights from complex datasets. My academic and professional pursuits reflect a commitment to advancing the understanding and practical implementation of intelligent, vision-based systems for engineering innovation.
